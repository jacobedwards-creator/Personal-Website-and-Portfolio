<h2>About Me</h2>
<h3>Reading</h3>
<p>In my free time I do a lot of reading, I really like lovecraftian horror books in particular, especially the cthulu mythos stories.</p>
<h3> Painting</h3>
<p>I do occasionally use painting as a creative outlet, I think focusing on something arbitrary can be really calming.</p>
<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>Gaming is probably what takes up most of my free time, I like to challenge myself so I'm partial to competitive and difficult games.</p>
